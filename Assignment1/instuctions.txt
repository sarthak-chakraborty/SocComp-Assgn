#### SOCIAL COMPUTING ASSIGNMENT 1 ####

1. To create subgraphs, type `$ python create_subgraph.py`. It will store the subgraph of both the networks in `subgraphs/` directory.
    For 'com-amazon.ungraph.txt', remove the few header lines in the edgelist file to avoid any error.

2. To run the code, type `$ python gen_structure.py <subgraphname>.elist`.
    Subgraph Names currently supported are `facebook` and `amazon`.

3. Versions used:
    python - 3.7.4 (`sudo apt install python`)
    gnuplot - 5.2 (`sudo apt install -y gnuplot`) [Only if Plot function of Snap is used, See Point No. 4]

4. If a virtual environment is created, make sure these libraries are installed:
    certifi==2020.6.20
    cycler==0.10.0
    kiwisolver==1.2.0
    matplotlib==3.3.2
    numpy==1.19.2
    pyparsing==2.4.7
    python-dateutil==2.8.1
    six==1.15.0
    snap-stanford==5.0.0

5. Part 3.c) Plot of the distribution of the shortest path lengths in the network.
    - If we use the function `snap.GetShortPath(G, NI.GetId(), NIdToDist)` to get the shortest path for every nodes in a looping strategy, it is taking around 12 minutes to plot the result and save it for the subgraph `amazon.elist`.
    - However, an alternate strategy forfaster combination is using `snap.PlotShortPathDistr()` which would require `gnuplot` to be installed[See Point. 2]. However, it will create additional files and the plot will be saved by the name of `diam.<Given Name>.png`.
